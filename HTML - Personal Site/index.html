      <p><em>Computer Science Student<br>Aspiring Software Engineer</em></p>
      <p> I am a Computer Science student graduating in early 2023. My favorite languages to program in are C#, Dart, and Javascript.<br>
        In addition to school assignments, I enjoy programming in my free time and engage in several personal projects, collaborations, online courses and bootcamps.<br>
        Other than programming I really enjoy cooking, baking, working with animals and playing video games with my friends.</p>
